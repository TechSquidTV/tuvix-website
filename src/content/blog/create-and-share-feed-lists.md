# Create and Share Feed Lists with OPML

One of the great things about RSS is that it's open and portable. You can easily migrate your subscriptions from one RSS reader to another using **OPML** files.
It's also a great way to curate feed lists and share them with others.
Have a collection of really cool bloggers that all document their experiences hand crafting traditional Polish wooden clogs?
Neat! You can easily share or publish that list of blogs with others.

## Exporting Your Tuvix Subscriptions

Exporting your feeds from Tuvix is simple:

![Exporting your feeds from Tuvix](../img/tuvix-opml-export-button.webp)

1. Go to your [Subscriptions page](https://feed.tuvix.app/app/subscriptions)
2. Look for the button labeled "Export" or with a down arrow icon.
3. Click the button to download your OPML file.

Tuvix exports everything — your feeds, categories, and even your custom filters—so you can restore your exact setup later or share it with others.
If you import your Tuvix OPML file into any other RSS reader, it will import your feeds and categories. However, it will not import your custom filters.

## Getting Started with Curated Feed Lists

New to RSS? Not sure where to start? We've created several curated OPML files to help you get started quickly. Download any of these curated OPML files and import just the feeds you want to subscribe to.

### Podcasts Feed List

Discover great podcasts across all genres. Browse popular shows on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/charts), covering technology, entertainment, news, true crime, comedy, and more.

> **Tip**: For podcasts, we recommend adding them directly using Apple Podcasts URLs rather than OPML files. While Apple Podcasts URLs aren't RSS feeds, Tuvix is smart enough to use them to fetch extra information like high-quality artwork for the podcast. OPML files only support RSS feed URLs, which for podcasts often don't contain the same artwork quality.
