# Tuvix Beta: Take Back Control of Your Feed

Today marks an exciting milestone—Tuvix is entering beta! After months of development, we're opening up to help everyone take back control of their internet experience. Whether you're a casual reader, a content creator, or someone who just wants to escape the algorithm, Tuvix is for you.

## Our Mission

The internet wasn't always about algorithmic feeds and engagement metrics. It used to be a collection of personal blogs, niche communities, and independent publishers. RSS gave us the power to follow what we wanted, not what an algorithm thought we should see.

**Tuvix is built on a simple belief: everyone deserves control over their information diet.** You shouldn't need to be a developer or tech expert to have a better internet experience. That's why we've designed Tuvix to be beautiful, simple, and accessible—while still being powerful enough for power users.

We're bringing back the open web, one feed at a time.

## What's Included in Beta

### Core Features

- **Clean Reading Experience**: Distraction-free interface focused on content—no clutter, no noise
- **Chronological Feeds**: No algorithms deciding what you see. Just content as it's published, in order
- **OPML Import/Export**: Already using another RSS reader? Bring all your feeds over in seconds
- **Folder Organization**: Organize feeds however makes sense to you—by topic, by priority, or however you think
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Navigate quickly without touching your mouse (for those who want it)

### Privacy by Design

- **Open Source**: Every line of code is visible on [GitHub](https://github.com/TechSquidTV/Tuvix-RSS). No hidden agendas, no surprises
- **Hosted Option**: Free hosted version with minimal tracking (just Sentry for error monitoring to help us improve)
- **Self-Hosting**: Want complete control? Host it yourself for zero tracking
- **No Data Sales**: We'll never sell your data. Ever.

### Publishing Features

One of our unique features is the ability to generate RSS feeds from your saved articles. Curate content and share your selections with the world—perfect for newsletters, reading lists, or just sharing what you love.

## What's Next

This is just the beginning. As we move through beta, we're planning:

- Enhanced filtering and search to find exactly what you're looking for
- Team/shared feeds for collaboration
- API for developers who want to build on top of Tuvix
- Integration with read-it-later services

**Note**: Tuvix is already a Progressive Web App (PWA), so you can install it on your mobile device for a native app-like experience without needing separate iOS or Android apps.

But we want to hear from you—what features matter most? What would make Tuvix better for your daily use?
