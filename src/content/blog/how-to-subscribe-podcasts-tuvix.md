# How to Subscribe and Listen to Podcasts on Tuvix

When podcasts were catching on in popularity in the early 2010s, one of the great things about them, was how easy and cheap they were to host yourself. Anyone who could setup a blog with an RSS feed, could also host a podcast; assuming they had a microphone. Podcast apps were just RSS readers with a built-in audio player.

Today, pocasting has largely been centralized into a few major platforms, like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Google Music. Luckily, so far, Apple Podcasts still offers RSS feeds for most podcasts, so you can still subscribe to them using RSS feeds. Spotify and Google Music, on the other hand, lock their content behind invasive tracking and advertising.

## Getting Started with Podcasts

If you've used the Apple Podcasts app before, you'll be right at home with Tuvix. Tuvix just supports subscribing to more than just podcasts. You'll be able to listen to blog posts as well if they publish audio.

### 1. Find Your Podcast

Tuvix supports Apple Podcasts natively. Simply find the podcast on Apple Podcasts, copy the URL

```
https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/pluribus-the-official-podcast/id1846198705
```

Tuvix will automatically discover the RSS feed and podcast artwork from Apple Podcasts, so you don't need to hunt down the RSS feed URL yourself.

### 2. Add the Podcast to Tuvix

Navigate to [https://feed.tuvix.app/app/subscriptions](https://feed.tuvix.app/app/subscriptions) and click "Add Subscription".

Then, paste the Apple Podcasts URL. Tuvix will automatically load up the RSS feed adn extract the podcast artwork.

### 3. Organize with Categories

When adding a podcast, you can organize it into categories. Consider creating categories like:
- **"Podcasts"** - For all your podcasts
- **"TV Podcasts"** - For shows about television and streaming
- **"News Podcasts"** - For daily news and current events

Categoires make it easier to find related content, and can also easily be turned into a public feed. So if you want to share a single RSS feed with all your favorite podcasts, a category is a great way to do that.

### 4. Listen to Episodes

Once you've subscribed to a podcast, new episodes will appear in your feed just like articles. When you open an episode, you'll see a built-in audio player at the top of the article.

The audio player includes:
- **Play/Pause controls** - Start and stop playback
- **Scrub bar** - Jump to any point in the episode
- **Time display** - See current time and total duration

### 5. Navigate Your Podcast Feed

Podcast episodes appear in chronological order in your feed, just like articles. You can:
- Browse episodes by scrolling through your feed
- Filter by category to see only podcasts
- Use the search function to find specific episodes
- Mark episodes as read or unread

## Pro Tips

> **Tip**: Tuvix automatically extracts audio enclosures from RSS feeds, so any podcast that publishes via RSS will work. Most major podcast platforms (Apple Podcasts, Spotify, etc.) use RSS feeds behind the scenes.

> **Tip**: Create separate categories for different types of podcasts. For example, you might have "Daily News" for morning news podcasts and "Deep Dives" for longer-form interview shows.

> **Tip**: Podcast episodes sync across all your devices when using the hosted version of Tuvix. Start listening on your computer and pick up where you left off on your phone.

> **Tip**: You can still open the original episode link to see show notes, transcripts, or comments on the podcast's website.

> **Tip**: Tuvix updates podcast feeds about every 15 minutes, so new episodes may take a few minutes to appear after they're published.

Happy listening! 🎧
